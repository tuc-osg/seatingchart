# Package seatingchart
Generation of seating charts

## Description
This package enables the visualization of seating charts, whereby the
seating arrangement (i.e. the arrangement of seats in a room) and the
seating scheme (i.e. the selection and labeling of occupied seats) can
be controlled independently of each other. 

This package should be considered experimental and requires LuaLaTeX.

## Installation
